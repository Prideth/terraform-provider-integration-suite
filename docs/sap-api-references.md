# SAP API References

Every implemented resource must trace back to an officially documented, SAP-supported public
API. This document is that trace.

> **Research note**: `help.sap.com`, `api.sap.com`, and `community.sap.com` were not directly
> reachable from the sandboxed environment this provider was initially developed in (blocked
> by network egress policy). Findings below were cross-checked through SAP's own
> `SAP-docs/btp-integration-suite` GitHub repository (the official Markdown source for the
> SAP Help Portal Integration Suite documentation) and SAP Business Accelerator Hub search
> results. Before relying on any exact field/entity name in production, verify it against the
> tenant's live `$metadata` document and the current SAP Business Accelerator Hub page —
> standard OData practice, and doubly important here given the access restriction noted
> above.

## `sapintegrationsuite_integration_package`

- **SAP product area**: Integration Suite / Cloud Integration
- **Official API**: Integration Content API (`CloudIntegrationAPI` package, SAP Business
  Accelerator Hub)
- **Entity set**: `IntegrationPackages`
- **Protocol**: OData V2
- **Operations**: GET, POST, DELETE (PUT limited to SAP-permitted metadata fields)
- **Required roles**: `IntegrationOperationServer` / `IntegrationDeveloper` OAuth scopes (role
  collection names vary per tenant; assign the least-privileged Integration Suite role
  collection covering "Integration Content" design-time operations)

## `sapintegrationsuite_integration_flow` / `..._deployment`

- **SAP product area**: Integration Suite / Cloud Integration
- **Official API**: Integration Content API
- **Entity sets / actions**: `IntegrationDesigntimeArtifacts`, `IntegrationRuntimeArtifacts`,
  `DeployIntegrationDesigntimeArtifact` (action)
- **Protocol**: OData V2
- **Operations**: GET, POST, DELETE, plus the `Deploy` action (POST)
- **Required roles**: as above, plus deploy-specific scopes for the runtime artifact
  operations

## `sapintegrationsuite_access_policy` / `..._reference`

- **SAP product area**: Integration Suite / Security
- **Official API**: Security Content API (documented by SAP as covering "keystore entries,
  user credentials, certificate-to-user mappings", and — per SAP's own access-policy
  documentation — access policies themselves, described as retrievable "by an OData V2 API"
  with both read and write operations)
- **Entity set**: `AccessPolicies`, with nested artifact references
- **Protocol**: OData V2
- **Operations**: GET, POST, PUT/MERGE, DELETE
- **Required roles**: Integration Suite "Manage Security" / access-policy administration
  scopes

## Deferred APIs (tracked, not yet implemented)

| Area | API | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Classic API Management | "Accessing API Management APIs Programmatically" REST/OData APIs | Confirmed public, deferred to a later minor version |
| New API Gateway / API Artifacts | Design-time API for API-centric artifacts with Runtime Profile (Integration Cell / Edge Integration Cell) | Existence confirmed via UI/feature docs; exact public API surface not yet confirmed in enough detail for a stable Terraform schema — deferred to v0.2.x |
| Partner Directory | Partner Directory API (part of the same `CloudIntegrationAPI` package) | Confirmed public, deferred — not yet schema-designed |
| Security material (user credentials, OAuth2 client credentials, keystore entries) | Security Content API | Confirmed public, deferred — needs write-only/sensitive-value design pass first |

## Explicitly ruled out

- **Integration Suite capability activation** (Cloud Integration, API Management, Integration
  Cell, Edge Integration Cell): no public activation API found. SAP's own documentation
  describes activation as a UI action ("Settings" → "Runtime" → *Activate*). Not implemented;
  see `docs/provisioning-capability-matrix.md`.
- Any endpoint only reachable by reverse-engineering the Integration Suite UI's network
  traffic. None were used, and none will be, regardless of how convenient they would be.
